# 4U (Programming language)
It's my programming language.

# How to use.

You must have ```gcc```, ```bison``` or ```yacc```, ```flex``` or ```lex``` for modify.
If you want not lodify, go to step .

## 1: Go to your directory

### Windows
On Windows, enter this command:
```batch
cd <directory name>
```
<directory name> is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
It's like ```C:\Users\user\Documents\4U\4U 0.0.0```

### Linux
On Linux, enter this command:
```bash
cd <directory name>
```
<directory name> is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
It's like ```/home/user/Documents/4U/4U\ 0.0.0``` (for with space enter ```\ ```).

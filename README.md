# 4U (Programming language)

The 4U is created by [@LAPCoder](https://github.com/LAPCoder).
It's a programming language.
Thanks [@Yagi-404](https://github.com/yagi-404) for his (big) help.

## What is it?

This is not only a programming language. It will be a code editor, a programming language, a doc, an IDE, an ODE, an extension for VS Code…

## The Latest version

V0.0.1 is the latest version.
V1.0.0 is in development.

## Objective

The main goal is to be useful, powerful, accessible, and easy to use.

Goal:
> Simpler than Python, more complete than C++, more object-oriented than Java, more interpreted than Python, more compiled than C, more cross-platform than HTML, here is the 4U!

Unfortunately, we are far from the goal.
So it is (and still) in (perpetual) development.

**For understanding**:

> Simpler than Python

The goal of language is to be accessible to everyone.

> More complete than C++

The 4U will have many functionalities (applications, games, websites, 2D, 3D, sound, image…).

> More object than Java, more interpreted than Python

It will be compiled ***and*** interpreted:

- For a quick overview (when designing software), it can be interpreted.
- For a slower rendering (but faster to execute), it can be compiled in machine language (as currently).

> More cross-platform than HTML

The 4U will be cross-platform.

## How to use

You must have `gcc`, `bison` or `yacc`, `flex` or `lex` and `glib`.

---
> **Warning!** For all commands, do not enter the `$` or the `>`!
---

### 1: Go to your directory

#### Windows

On Windows, enter this command:

```bat
> cd <directory name>
```

`<directory name>` is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
The path is like `C:\Users\user\Documents\src\'4U 0.0.0'`

#### Linux

On Linux, enter this command:

```bash
$ cd <directory name>
```

`<directory name>` is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
The path is like `/home/user/Documents/src/'4U 0.0.0'` or `~/Documents/src/'4U 0.0.0'`.

### 2: Compile the lexical analyzer
  
Enter this command (if you use `flex`):

```bash
$ flex -o lexique_4u.c lexique_4u.lex
```

### 3: Compile the syntax analyzer
  
Enter this command (if you use `bison`):

```bash
$ bison -d syntax_4u.y
```

### 4: Compile the compiler

#### v0.x.x
  
Enter this command (if you use `gcc`) to compile the compiler:

```bash
$ gcc lexique_4u.c syntax_4u.tab.c generation_code.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -o 4u
```

#### v1.x.x

Enter this command (if you use `gcc`) to compile the compiler:

```bash
$ gcc lexique_4u.c syntax_4u.tab.c generation_code_c.c generation_code_js.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -o 4u
```

### 5: Execute the 4U program

Enter this command (if you use `gcc`) in a terminal to transform the 4U code in C:

```bash
$ ./4u program.4u
```

`<program.4u>` is the name of your program.

### 6: Compile the program

Enter this command to compile the C program:

```bash
$ gcc program.c
```

`<program.c>` is the name of your program (compiled).

### 7: Compile the program

#### Windows

Enter this command to run the compiled program:

```bat
> ./a.exe
```

#### Linux

Enter this command to run the compiled program:

```bash
$ ./a.out
```

### 8: End

It's OK! Your code was executed! If you want to re-execute your code (and it's not changed), you can just do this command (step 7).
Else, you can execute (if you want):

```bash
$ cd
```

## Compile Command

**AT THE TIME, THE COMMAND DOESN'T WORK. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT INSTALLING NOW. IT'S COMING SOON, BUT AT THE TIME IT'S IN BETA.**

You can go [here](/commands) for more informations.

### Windows

To compile command, here is a simple way to do it on Windows. Go to the 4U command file and type:

```bat
> mkdir bin
> gcc *.c -o bin/4U
```

It will create an executable. If you want to use it all days, we really recommend add the `bin/` folder into the PATH.

Whatever, if you want a normal installation of the 4U command (without compiling),
we'll put an executable file in our website soon. You need to put it in a folder that you added to PATH.

### Linux

Sorry, at the moment ***commands are not tested for Linux***. But you can try compiling them with `gcc`.

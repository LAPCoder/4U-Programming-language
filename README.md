## What is it?

This is not only a programming language. It's will be a code editor, a programming language, a doc, an IDE, an ODE...

## Lastest version

V0.0.1 is the lastest version.
V1.0.0 is in developpement.

# Objective

The main goal is to be useful, powerful, accessible and easy to use. <br />
Goal:
> Simpler than Python, more complete than C++, more object-oriented than Java, more interpreted than Python, more compiled than C, more cross-platform than HTML, here is the 4U!

Unfortunately, we are far from the goal.
So it is (and still) in (perpetual) development.

**For understanding**:

> Simpler than Python

The goal of language is to be accessible to everyone.

> More complete than C++

The 4U will have many different functionalities (applications, games, websites, 2D, 3D, sound, image...)

> More object than Java, more interpreted than Python

It will be compiled ***and*** interpreted:
- For a quick overview (when designing software), it can be interpreted.
- For a slower rendering (but faster to execute), it can be compiled in machine language (as currently).

> More cross-platform than HTML

The 4U will be cross-platform.

# How to use

You must have `gcc`, `bison` or `yacc`, `flex` or `lex` and `glib`.
<!-- If you want not modify, you must have `gcc`, and go to step 1, 5, 6 and 7.
If you want execute example-program, just go to step 1 and 7. -->

## 1: Go to your directory

### Windows

On Windows, enter this command:
```batch
cd <directory name>
```
\<directory name\> is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
It's like `C:\Users\user\Documents\4U\4U 0.0.0`

### Linux

On Linux, enter this command:
```bash
cd <directory name>
```
\<directory name\> is the directory where you installed folder "4u vX.X.X" (X.X.X is your version number).
It's like `/home/user/Documents/4U/4U\ 0.0.0` (for with space enter `\ `).

## 2: Compile the lexical analyzer
  
Enter this command (if you use `flex`):
```bash
flex -o lexique_4u.c lexique_4u.lex
```
## 3: Compile the syntax analyzer
  
Enter this command (if you use `bison`):
```bash
bison -d syntax_4u.y
```

## 4: Compile the compiler
  
Enter this command (if you use `gcc`):
```bash
gcc lexique_4u.c syntax_4u.tab.c generation_code.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0` -o 4u
```

## 5: Execute the 4u program

Enter this command (if you use `gcc`) in a terminal (CMD):
```bash
./4u program.4u
```
\<program.4u\> is the name of your program.

## 6: Compile the program

Enter this command:
```bash
gcc program.c
```
\<program.c\> is the name of your program (compiled).

## 7: Compile the program

Enter this command:
```bash
./a.out
```
It's OK! Your code was executed! If you want to re-execute your code (and it's not changed), you can just do this command (step 7).
Else, you can execute (if you want):
```bash
cd
```

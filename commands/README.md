# Commands

Here is command files.
<!--
Usage:
```
--help / -H   Displays the commands
--version / -V  Displays the version of the 4U compiler
```-->

## Compile Command

To compile command, here is a simple way to do it on Windows. Go in the 4U command file and type

```bat
$ mkdir bin
$ gcc *.c -o bin/4U
```

It will create an executable. If you want to use it alldays, I really recommand add the bin/ folder into the PATH.

Whatever, if you want a normal installation of the 4U command (without compiling),
I'll put an executable file in our website soon. You need to put it in a folder that you added to PATH.

**AT THE TIME, THE COMMAND DOSEN'T WORKS. WE HIGHLY RECOMMAND NOT INSTALLING NOW. IT'S COMING SOON BUT AT THE TIME IT'S IN BETA.**

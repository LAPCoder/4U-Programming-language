	<p class="main-content">
		At the time, this language has not a lot of intresting features. But one of the biggest comming soon is that the language can be compiled or
		interpreted ! <br>
		<h3>What does it actually means ?</h3>
		<p class="main-content">
			You are probally thinking that it will be like Java, but it's not ! We will make a compiler, for performaces, and interpreter for 
			mulitplateform. It's a pretty intresting feature, isn't it ?
			Whatever, at the time to install 4U, you need to put the source code into your 4U project, wich is very annoying. It will be
			global soon also.
			It will have it own command wich will be <code>$ foryou</code>
